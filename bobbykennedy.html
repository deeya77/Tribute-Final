  	<p>On the 50th anniversary of Robert F. Kennedy's death, Michael Dobie, Newsday, believes that RFK's message must still matter.</p>

  	<hr>

  	<blockquote cite="https://www.newsday.com/opinion/columnists/michael-dobie/robert-kennedy-1.18896435">
  	....there is no debate that his was a message for troubled times. He wasnâ€™t a saint, but he spoke of fairness and equality, social justice and racial tolerance....	
  	</blockquote>

  	<hr>

  	<p>Dobie believes that "if we remember what Bobby stood for, we have a chance to give today's 12-year-olds the world that Bobby hoped would come."</p>

  	<div id="quotes">
	  		<div class="rfk-quotes short">"There are those who look at things the way they are, and ask why... I dream of things that never were, and ask why not?"</div>

	  		<div class="rfk-quotes long">"Every time we turn our heads the other way when we see the law flouted, when we tolerate what we know to be wrong, when we close our eyes and ears to the corrupt because we are too busy or too frightened, when we fail to speak up and speak out, we strike a blow against freedom and decency and justice."</div>

	  			<hr>

	  		<div class="rfk-quotes long">"What is objectionable, what is dangerous, about extremists is not that they are extreme, but that they are intolerant. The evil is not what they say about their cause, but what they say about their opponents."</div>

	  		<div class="rfk-quotes short">"It is the essence of responsibility to put the public good ahead of personal gain..."</div>

	  		<div class="rfk-quotes long">"We must recognize the full human equality of all our people - before God, before the law, and in the councils of government. We must do this not because it is economically advantageous - although it is; not because the laws of God and man command it - although they do command it; not because people in other lands wish it so. We must do it for the single and fundamental reason that it is the right thing to do."</div>

	  			<hr>
	  	
	  		<div class="rfk-quotes long">"Few will have the greatness to bend history itself; but each of us can work to change a small portion of events, and in the total; of all those acts will be written the history of this generation."</div>
	  		
	  		<div class="rfk-quotes short">"Every time you stand up for an ideal, you send forth a tiny ripple of hope."</div>

	  		<div class="rfk-quotes long">"It is from the numberless diverse acts of courage and belief that human history is shaped. Each time a man stands up for an ideal or acts to improve the lot of others or strikes out against injustice, he sends forth a tiny ripple of hope, and crossing each other from a million different centers of energy and daring, those ripples build a current that can sweep down the mightiest walls of oppression and resistance."</div>

	  			<hr>

	  		<div class="rfk-quotes long">"Our attitude towards immigration reflects our faith in the American ideal. We have always believed it possible for men and women who start at the bottom to rise as far as the talent and energy allow. Neither race nor place of birth should affect their chances."</div>

	  		<div class="rfk-quotes short">"Ultimately, America's answer to the intolerant man is diversity, the very diversity which our heritage of religious freedom has inspired."</div>

	  		<div class="rfk-quotes long">"Whenever any American's life is taken by another American unnecessarily - whether it is done in the name of the law or in the defiance of the law, by one man or a gang, in cold blood or in passion, in an attack of violence or in response to violence - whenever we tear at the fabric of the life which another man has painfully and clumsily woven for himself and his children, the whole nation is degraded."</div>

	  			<hr>

	  		<div class="rfk-quotes long">"Together, we can make ourselves a nation that spends more on books than on bombs, more on hospitals than the terrible tools of war, more on decent houses than military aircraft."</div>

	  		<div class="rfk-quotes short">"Only those who dare to fail greatly can ever achieve greatly."</div>

	  		<div class="rfk-quotes long">"The essential humanity of men can be protected and preserved only where government must answer, not just to the wealthy, not just to those of a particular religion, or a particular race, but to all its people."</div>

	  			<hr>

	  		<div class="rfk-quotes long">"What we need in the United States is not division; what we need in the United States is not hatred; what we need in the United States is not violence or lawlessness; but love and wisdom, and compassion toward one another, and a feeling of justice toward those who still suffer within our country, whether they be white or they be black."</div>

	  		<div class="rfk-quotes short">"What has violence ever accomplished? What has it ever created? No martyr's cause has ever been stilled by an assassin's bullet..."</div>

	  		<div class="rfk-quotes long">"When you teach a man to hate and fear his brother, when you teach that he is a lesser man because of his color or his beliefs or the policies he pursues, when you teach that those who differ from you threaten your freedom or your job or your family, then you also learn to confront others not as fellow citizens but as enemies..."</div>

	  			<hr>

	  		<div class="rfk-quotes long">"The future does not belong to those who are content with today Rather, it will belong to those who can blend vision, reason, and courage in a personal commitment."</div>
